# AR-hand-tracking

**Description:**Â In this work, we developed a real-time system of markerless augmented reality, in which we use the tracking of the user's hand (wearing a black glove) to position virtual information over the real environment. All the system was developed in C++.

**Work Proposal:** Implementation of a MAR system capable of estimating, in real-time, the position and orientation of the hand from the captured video.

- Study about the Augmented Reality (RA) area, mainly RA markerless (MAR);
- Study the area of Digital Image Processing, specifically filters, and segmentation;
- Study Computer Vision, especially object recognition and tracking;
- Segmentation, recognize and tracking the hand, to be used in MAR;
- Estimate the camera pose from the detected hand;
- Conduct studies related to the performance and viability of the developed system.
